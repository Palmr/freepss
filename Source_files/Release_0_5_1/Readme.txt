:What is the Shoutbox System?
-----------------------------
The Shoutbox System is a system based on a PHP script that uses the GD library to render the shoutbox image straight to the screen.
This gives you the added advantage of including the shoutbox on any forum or website, and have it update automatically every time the page is refreshed.
Not only that, but the shoutbox comes complete with a page for users to easily shout in your box, and an admin page for you to easily  
alter any details.


:Why did I download this?
-------------------------
You downloaded it because you wanted a cool and nifty shoutbox like everyone else!
Or because you have PHP hosting that was going to waste and you thought you might install several copies and give them to other's without the capability to get PHP hosting. Because you're kind ^^
If you are caught selling these on with no added features then you will be told off or even worse....NAMED AND SHAMED!!


:What do I do with it?
----------------------
So you must have already downloaded and extracted the files to be able to read this I take it.
Well you will now have a folder called 'shoutbox'. This is the folder containing all the shoutbox files and the one you will need to upload to your web space.
You can upload it via any means possible. The most common would be FTP or file by file. Either way will be fine just so long as all the files and folders in the shoutbox folder stay in the same place relative to each other.
Once uploaded to your server you're pretty much ready to roll!
You can try going to the folder on your server where you uploaded it and post a message. If you get no message posted and "Please tell the admin he has not set the permissions right on the 'XXX' file." at the top of the page you need to find out how to edit file permissions, and set the 'content.txt' and 'config.php' files to '0777'.
Once you are able to post you'll want to put '+pass' in the Username box, and '+edit' in the Message box.
Once in the admin page you can change the admin name to your name and the password to your choice of password.
You can also alter the amount of items in the RSS feed and whether to show timestamps. The other fields, don’t mess with those unless you read the online readme!
Save those settings and you're done! To post with your name now you put the password you used in the Username field.
If you want to customise the look of the shoutbox, or the website feel free, but please keep the footer and comments the same. Anyone found to be in violation with these terms will not only receive a telling off, but also public humiliation by being NAMED AND SHAMED!


:Does it really work?
---------------------
Well of course it does!
Wouldn’t be much use us giving it to you, you downloading it and then uploading it again if it didn't work.
There is no catch. Well, apart from keeping the credits, but that's more common courtesy than a rule.
Look here to see it in action: http://sandbox.palmnet.me.uk/shoutbox/


:Who made this?
---------------
Why it was me, of course!
Me being Nick Palmer, aka Palmnet. http://www.palmnet.me.uk
The posting page design was done by Philip Wylie of PWnet. http://www.pwnet.org.uk
The code for word wrapping in the shoutbox was done by a kindly fellow named Rydian Morrison.
Various other people have added their own input and code, put '+credits' in the message field to see them all.


:Why did they make this?
------------------------
Well me, Nick, wanted one all for myself, but never really got round to it due to the word wrapping conundrum. But thanks to a lot of help from Rydian, and some nifty design from PWnet, It's all been put together in one easy package for you all to share the joy.
We all believe open source is the recipe for a good program or a "killer" app. And this is our first, of hopefully many, Open Source applications.
