:What is the Shoutbox System?
-----------------------------
The Shoutbox System is a system based on a PHP script that uses the GD library to render the shoutbox image straight to the screen.
This gives you the added advantage of including the shoutbox on any forum or website, and have it update automatically every time the page is refreshed.
Not only that, but the shoutbox comes complete with a page for users to easily shout in your box, and an admin page for you to easily  
alter any details.


:Why did I download this?
-------------------------
You downloaded it because you wanted a cool and nifty shoutbox like everyone else!
Or because you have PHP hosting that was going to waste and you thought you might install several copies and give them to others without the capability to get PHP hosting. Because you're kind ^^


:What do I do with it?
----------------------
I have written an extremely extensive guide on many aspects on what to do once you've downloaded the shoutbox.
You can find it here: http://www.howtousea.com/shoutbox


:Does it really work?
---------------------
Well of course it does!
Wouldn’t be much use us giving it to you, you downloading it and then uploading it again if it didn't work.
There is no catch. Well, apart from keeping the credits, but that's more common courtesy than a rule.
Look here to see it in action: http://sandbox.palmnet.me.uk/shoutbox/


:Who made this?
---------------
Why it was me, of course!
Me being Nick Palmer, aka Palmnet. http://www.palmnet.me.uk
The posting page design was done by Philip Wylie of PWnet. http://www.pwnet.org.uk
The code for word wrapping in the shoutbox was done by a kindly fellow named Rydian Morrison.
Various other people have added their own input and code, put '+credits' in the message field to see them all.


:Why did they make this?
------------------------
Well me, Nick, wanted one all for myself, but never really got round to it due to the word wrapping conundrum. But thanks to a lot of help from Rydian, and some nifty design from PWnet, It's all been put together in one easy package for you all to share the joy.
We all believe open source is the recipe for a good program or a "killer app". And this is our first, of hopefully many, Open Source applications.
