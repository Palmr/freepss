=Evolution Group Shoutbox v1.0=
Be warned, I do waffle here a little bit. But read it all. It's good to learn rather than skip and miss the important bits!


==What is the "Evolution Group Shoutbox v1.0"?==
The *Evolution Group Shoutbox v1.0* is a PHP script for generating a single image file to display an interactive chat-like system.


==Ok, so whats it for?==
The main concept of a _Shoutbox_ is that you have one place where you can send anyone for them to easily drop you a message.
This can be done with really great scripts like [http://yurivish.com/yshout/ YShout]. However a problem arises with these: "I want to use it in a site that doesn't allow PHP includes".
This is solved in the *Evolution Group Shoutbox v1.0* solution by making the actual shoutbox itself into a flat, single image.
Images are easy to include on pretty much any website via HTML, BBCode or other forms of online scripting.


==Ah, cool. So how do I get one?==
[http://code.google.com/p/freepss/downloads/list Go here] And download it in either a RAR archive or a ZIP archive.


==Ok, got it on my pc...Now what??==
Well you need to put it on a web server.
Not just any web server I'm afraid, but one with PHP. If you dont already have a place to upload this system you can pay for hosting at sites like these:
  * http://www.bluehost.com/
  * http://www.t35.com/personalhosting.shtml
  * http://www.1and1.co.uk/
Or you can get free hosting here:
  * http://www.0php.com/
  * http://www.t35.com/freehosting.shtml
  * http://www.awardspace.com/web_hosting.html
Once you have hosting you need to upload the files that are _Inside_ the archive.
So extract the archive, and upload the */shoutbox/* folder with all the files inside it to your web server.
If you don't know how to upload the file then you should try asking your web-hosts. If they cant tell you, or you don't know how to contact them, ask here if you are a Gaia member: [http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=43 Computers & Technology Forum]
Once the files are uploaded you can start using it!
Just goto the place you uploaded it to and try to post.
If you get a "Please tell the admin he has not set the permissions right on the '???' file." message and no messages are posted then read [http://code.google.com/p/freepss/wiki/HowToCHMOD THIS].


==Anything else I need to know?==
Yes! Just one more thing!
In the username field put '+pass' and in the message field put '+edit' and hit "Shout"
You are now in the admin panel!
Change the username to your nickname. Change the password field to something suitable.
Leave the "Content file location" as it is. DO NOT CHANGE THIS!
You can alter the number of items in the RSS feed, between 10-30 is acceptable really.
Turn the timestamps on or off. Depends how you like it.
And the other fields you can read [http://code.google.com/p/freepss/wiki/HowToCustomise Here] to find more info.
Click "Save Changes" and everything is done.


==You say done, but how do I add it to a website?==
Post one of these, whatever is appropriate. And obviously change the site name and folder to point to the right site!
