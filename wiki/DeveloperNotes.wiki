This is a basic list of every function in the project, what it does, why it does it and what you could do with it.
I'll also discuss some of the things I've gone through making this system

== Why should I read this? ==
You should be reading this if:
  # You know PHP and want to learn how to use some of the code I used.
  # You want to learn PHP.
  # You are just plain nerdy/geeky/curious.
Basically, if you have better things to do, do them first!
This is pretty in-depth and will be mostly blanked out by the general public.

== Preamble ==
I'll list all the functions I made, then list them all again with how/what they do.
Then after that little joy I'll list of some of the basic PHP functions I used, how and what they were used for too.

== Function list ==
All functions I made are in _functions.php_
There are also some if($_POST[]) in there, which I'll talk about later on.

=== writetofile($content) ===
This takes whatever is passed via $content and writes it to $contentfile.
$contentfile is a global variable taken from config.php
This function is twice in the system. Once for adding a post via postmsg() and once when saving after editing.

=== writeconfig($content) ===
This takes whatever is passed via $content and saves it in config.php
Only used once, in: if($_POST['editcfg']).

=== postmsg($username,$message) ===
This takes an already sanitised $username and $message, adds a timestamp to it, adds that onto the rest of the content in content.txt, and then uses writetofile() to save it.
Only used from the post.php file.

=== isadmin($password) ===
Checks if $password that was passed to it matches the $adminpassword from the config.php
Only used from the post.php when checking to see if it can display the edit form.
Returns True or False.

=== validpost($username,$message) ===
Checks for empty $username or $message values.
Any problems it finds it uses s set of ifs to return an error message.
Only used from the post.php

=== editform() ===
This is used to return the edit form. It grabs the global variables it needs and the content.txt data and then echo's that in a nice form for easy editing.
Only called from the post.php

=== postform($errormessage) ===
This is used to return the posting form. It concatenates the image, a possible error message passed to it with the $errormessage parameter, and the post form.
Only called from the post.php

=== displayhistory($item) ===
This displays a nice little history of the past 5 items with links to browse back and forth between them.
Only used from the post.php if "?item=" is specified in the URL.

=== bool2check($booleanvalue) ===
Returns "checked" if $booleanvalue = True, and "" if $booleanvalue = False.
Used in the editform() function to check the timestamp box or not dependent upon the config.php file.

=== check2bool($checkvalue) ===
Returns True if $checkvalue= "on", and False if $checkvalue= "".
Used in the writeconfig() to write a true or false value for the timestamps.

=== hex2rgb($hex, $value) ===
Returns the 0-255 RGB values of $hex dependent upon the $value.
$value can be set to "r", "g" and "b". If left blank it returns all three comma seperated.
Used once in image.php for allocating the colour of the font.

=== msgfilter($message) ===
Will return a nice, clean, version of whatever was passed to it via $message.
It strips all non-allowed characters with the first 2 lines of code.
Then it corrects foolish, common, typos.
And then it Places a {{{*}}} for every letter of a word in the $not_very_nice array apart from the first and last character.
This final, clean data, is then capitalised and returned to the user.
Used twice when it gets the values for the username and message from the $_POST[] variables.

=== credits($username) ===
This returns the credits for the shoutbox system, and a message to thank the user passed to it via $username.
Used once in post.php

=== geturl() ===
Returns the full URL of the document that uses this function.
This function was used in the rss.php, but no longer is.
However I left it in for those of you who may need the code. Trust me, it's a handy one to have about!

=== geturldir() ===
This returns the path the to document that called it.
Used by the displayhistory() function and index.php rss.php

=== regex_timestamp_off($line) ===
Fully removes the timestamp from $line for 0.5, 0.5.X and 1.0 content items.
Done using a regular expression.
Used in image.php and rss.php

=== regex_timestamp_cutdown($line) ===
Returns a nice, small timestamp and message from the $line parameter. Works with 0.5, 0.5.X and 1.0 content items.
Used in image.php and rss.php

=== regex_only_timestamp($line) ===
Removes all but the timestamp from $line.
Used in rss.php for the <pubDate></pubDate>
