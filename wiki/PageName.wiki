=A basic guide to a custom shoutbox image=
This is just a small guide showing how to change the look of the shoutbox to something more custom and to suit your needs.
You will need an image editor, a popular free one is [http://www.gimp.org/ The Gimp]. And thats it, no scripting or coding knowledge needed!

==Guide: 1 - Basic custom==
This bit of the guide will let you know how to tweak the shoutbox and some of the stuff included you might not know about.

===Editing the standard image===
To edit the standard image I'd suggest using a tool like The Gimp as it can handle .png format images with layers and transparencies nicely. I'll be using Adobe Fireworks 8 for the screen shots though.


==Guide: 2 - Fully custom==
This bit of the guide will let you know how to tweak the shoutbox and some of the stuff included you might not know about.

===Creating a new image===
